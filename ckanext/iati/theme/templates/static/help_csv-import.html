  <h1>CSV Imports</h1>

  <p>The registry CSV Import utility allows you to publish, or re-publish, your metadata by uploading a spreadsheet.</p>
  <p>The following table details the fields in the <a href="http://iatiregistry.org/csv/download/template">CSV file template</a>.  For example metadata, we have used the <a href="http://iatiregistry.org/dataset/dfid-af">DFID flle for Afghanistan</a>. </p>
 
	<table class="table table-striped">
	<thead>
	<tr><th>Field</th><th>Notes</th><th>Example</th></tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
	<tr><td>registry-publisher-id</td><td>This must match your registry ID that your user account has permission to update.</td><td>dfid</td></tr>
	<tr><td>registry-file-id</td><td>This must be the id of the package you wish to create or update.</td><td>dfid-af</td></tr>
	<tr><td>title</td><td>The title of this file</td><td>DFID Activity File Afghanistan</td></tr>

	<tr><td>last-updated-datetime</td><td>The date the file was last updated.  NB: the registry will pick up subsequent update dates via the nightly check, so this field is not essential in the CSV upload.</td><td>2013-11-29 04:44</td></tr>
